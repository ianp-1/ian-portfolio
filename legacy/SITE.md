# Site Vision - Ian Pang (CS SWE Portfolio)

## Vision

A premium, high-performance portfolio for a Computer Science Software Engineering student. The design should be minimalist but sophisticated, utilizing the "Shadcn UI" aesthetic: clean lines, crisp typography (Inter/Geist), subtle animations, and a focus on content hierarchy. It should signal technical competence and attention to detail.

## Sitemap
